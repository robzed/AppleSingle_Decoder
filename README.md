## BACKGROUND NOTES
AppleSingle is a format for putting Mac data and resource forks into a single file. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle_and_AppleDouble_formats

The problem for us was porting a cvs repo (where we used MacCVS Pro) to svn ... then to git left a lot of files stuck in this format. Hence this tool.
